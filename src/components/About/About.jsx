      Hello, I'm Sahana Saravanan, a Junior Web Developer with a passion for crafting innovative, responsive, and dynamic web applications.
       With a solid foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, I am driven by the goal of enhancing user experiences and making the web an intuitive and engaging space for all.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the years, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a commitment to quality, ensuring that every project
       I work on meets the highest standards of design and functionality. My skills extend to back-end development with databases like MySQL and MongoDB, giving me a well-rounded understanding of full-stack web development.
